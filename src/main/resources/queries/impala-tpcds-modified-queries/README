These queries are older queries from impala-tpcds-kit.  They are based on version 1.1 of TPC-DS
https://github.com/cloudera/impala-tpcds-kit/tree/v1.4/queries-sql92-modified/queries/shark

Note that the current impala-tpcds-kit queries are different to these old queries.

To quote from their page:
> For Shark to function/execute queries correctly we had to add MapJoin hints. All the shark queries along with RDD creation sql can be found in shark subdir.

They have been used and referenced by several prior work.  For example, the following two Cloudera blog posts use the modified queries as a benchmark:
 - http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2014/01/impala-performance-dbms-class-speed/
 - https://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2014/05/new-sql-choices-in-the-apache-hadoop-ecosystem-why-impala-continues-to-lead/
 
This set of queries was also used in the paper "Making sense of performance in data analytics frameworks" by Ousterhout et. al.
